## Installation

This code was developed with Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 16.04 with ROS Kinetic.  Python requirements can be found in `requirements.txt`.

You will also require the [Kinova ROS Packages](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-ros) and [Realsense Camera Packages](http://wiki.ros.org/realsense_camera).

A 3D printed mount for the Intel Realsense SR300 on the Kinova Jaco arm can be found in the `cad` folder.
